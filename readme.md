5/8 Problems
1) Try to implement the codes that when user clicks the buttons it showed the digits and operators and the add it to the next digits or operator( which means store the value and change the display)

2) Now, it does change the content on the display but it changes everytime when user clicks the other buttons. and also need to fix the problem that it shows them on the left top corner. 

3) And with the operators and i named thema as commandor, they can only work when there are/is digits if there are/is not it should detect that and shouldn't work it supposed to be. 

so for that I'm thinking of using if statement to check the display has the numbers or not. Since I need to store the digits and operators to show them in the display (but also use it to run the codes as a calculator I can store the varible and then show that digits insided the display and work as it supposed to do.)
