5/8 Problems
1) Try to implement the codes that when user clicks the buttons it showed the digits and operators and the add it to the next digits or operator( which means store the value and change the display)

2) Now, it does change the content on the display but it changes everytime when user clicks the other buttons. and also need to fix the problem that it shows them on the left top corner. 

3) And with the operators and i named thema as commandor, they can only work when there are/is digits if there are/is not it should detect that and shouldn't work it supposed to be. 

so for that I'm thinking of using if statement to check the display has the numbers or not. Since I need to store the digits and operators to show them in the display (but also use it to run the codes as a calculator I can store the varible and then show that digits insided the display and work as it supposed to do.)

5/9 

1) show the text on the right bottom of the display then when it hits the maximum width of the display size it shrink first then it keeps showing add the number but won't exceed the display box.

2) then I found that I can get a textcontent from the text box by storing it into the variable

3) second problem is I have to make a function that it detect the two separate numbers so that it can operate the other functions
   1) how are you gonna set a varible and use it for the function 
   2) so from that function we need to call... real calculator functions 
   3) which is if I know how to detect and store the variable then i can call the function with those valuables


3) change the plans I'll make the function that it calls the operate function while store the numbers into two varaibles then i'll call that function when user hits the operators
